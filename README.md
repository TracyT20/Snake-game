Python Snake Game

This is the classic snake game, built entirely in python using the Tkinter Library and implemented using object oriented programming.

Control snake using up,down,left and right keys,ensuring not to hit a wall or your tail.

Everytime the snake eats the food it grows, its speed increases, the score increases and the food re-apears at a random position.
